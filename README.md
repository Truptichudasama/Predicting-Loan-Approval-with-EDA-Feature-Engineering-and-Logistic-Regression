# Predicting-Loan-Approval-with-EDA-Feature-Engineering-and-Logistic-Regression


This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or not using **Logistic Regression**.  
It demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, from data exploration to model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical task for financial institutions. By analyzing applicant details such as income, credit history, and loan amount, we can build a predictive model to assist in decision-making.

This project uses **Logistic Regression**, a widely used classification algorithm, to predict loan approval status.
